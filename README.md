# Home site of pdxmesh.net

### Overview


This website is built using Jekyll. It's meant to be very simple and straightforward to update. Some basic protections are in place for the repository - namely a protected master branch. 

### Contributing

Basic branching strategy will be leveraged - dev branches created, PRs for merging dev branch into master. A dev environment will be made available to those who need it - we will need to see the site in action before merging into master and deploying live. Automatic deployment will occur via webhook.
