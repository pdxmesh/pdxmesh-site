Hi all!

I just stood this whole domain up two days ago and I've rolled out the following services:

* Matrix stack
  1. Synapse server (https://matrix.pdxmesh.net)
  1. [Riot.im web interface](https://chat.pdxmesh.net)
  1. Turn server (provides voip services within Riot.im)
* cjdns node
  1. {"password": "8qlgz6b6l30qhz8ygsgrmn45t254ljl", "user": "public-peer"}

I plan on putting some more up, but I'd like to get other folks involved. If you're interested, hit me up in Riot or email me at pdxmesh at gmail dot com!
