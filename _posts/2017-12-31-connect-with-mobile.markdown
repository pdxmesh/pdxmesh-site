In order to connect to the PDX MeshNet Matrix server with [a mobile client](/assets/img/android-login-1.png), you need to configure the client to connect to a custom Home server. After starting the client, enter in your username and password that you used with the web client. Then check the box that says [Use custom server options](/assets/img/android-login-2.png), and enter ***https://matrix.pdxmesh.net*** for the home server url.
